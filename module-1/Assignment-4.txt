Sentiment Analysis Exercise

Objective: Gain hands-on experience with sentiment analysis using NLP.

In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on a collection of text data. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in each text entry. You will select a dataset containing text data, analyze the sentiment of the entries, and provide a summary of the sentiment analysis results along with any insights or challenges encountered.

Instructions:

Data Selection:

Choose a collection of text data for sentiment analysis. You can consider datasets from various sources, such as customer reviews, tweets, news articles, or any other text data of interest.
Ensure that your dataset contains a sufficient number of text entries for meaningful analysis.
Sentiment Analysis:

Utilize NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the selected dataset. You can use pre-trained sentiment analysis models or libraries in Python (e.g., NLTK, TextBlob, VADER) to help with this task.
For each text entry in the dataset, determine its sentiment and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.
Summary:

Summarize the results of your sentiment analysis. Provide statistics or visualizations, such as the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
Discuss any interesting insights or trends you observe in the data. For example, are there specific keywords or phrases that frequently appear in positive or negative sentiments?
Challenges:

Highlight any challenges or limitations you encountered during the sentiment analysis process. Did certain entries pose difficulties in sentiment classification, and if so, why?
Documentation:

Document your code, the tools or libraries you used, and the step-by-step process you followed.
Example Output:

Provide an example of a text entry from your dataset, along with its sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral) and a brief explanation of why it received that classification.
Dataset:

You will need to obtain or create a dataset for this assignment.
Programming Language:

You can use Python or any other programming language suitable for NLP and sentiment analysis.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your assignment in a well-organized format, such as a Jupyter Notebook, Python script, or any other suitable format.
Ensure that your code is well-documented and includes comments explaining each step of the sentiment analysis process.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of sentiment analysis using NLP techniques.
Clarity and quality of the summary of sentiment analysis results.
Discussion of insights and trends observed in the data.
Identification and explanation of challenges or limitations encountered.
Example output showcasing a text entry, sentiment classification, and explanation.
Adherence to submission guidelines.
