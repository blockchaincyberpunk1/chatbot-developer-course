Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Objective: Understand the core concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

In this assignment, you will dive into the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a crucial component of chatbot development. You will explore key NLP concepts such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER). Additionally, you will learn how NLP is applied in everyday applications, enhancing your understanding of its practical relevance.

Instructions:

Tokenization:

Define and explain the concept of tokenization in NLP.
Provide a clear example of tokenization by taking a sentence and breaking it down into individual tokens. Explain why tokenization is essential in NLP.
Part-of-Speech Tagging:

Define part-of-speech tagging and its significance in NLP.
Offer an example sentence with part-of-speech tags for each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). Explain how part-of-speech tagging aids in language analysis.
Named Entity Recognition (NER):

Define Named Entity Recognition (NER) and its purpose in NLP.
Provide an example sentence and highlight the named entities it contains (e.g., names of people, organizations, locations). Explain the practical applications of NER.
Everyday NLP Applications:

Identify at least two everyday applications where NLP plays a crucial role. Examples include:
Virtual Assistants: Explain how NLP is used in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa to understand and respond to user voice commands.
Social Media Sentiment Analysis: Describe how NLP techniques are employed to analyze social media content and determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
Format:

Your assignment can be presented in a written format (document or essay) or as a presentation with clear slides (e.g., PowerPoint).
Submission Guidelines:

Follow academic writing conventions (if submitting a document).
If presenting as slides, ensure your presentation is clear, organized, and visually appealing.
