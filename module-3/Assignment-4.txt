Transformers for Chatbots

Objective: Explore the Hugging Face Transformers library for advanced NLP tasks.

In this assignment, you will delve into advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) by exploring the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides access to pre-trained transformer models. You will research and implement a chatbot prototype that utilizes a pre-trained transformer model for conversational generation.

Instructions:

Research Hugging Face Transformers:

Research and provide an overview of the Hugging Face Transformers library. Explain its purpose and significance in the field of NLP.
Explore the pre-trained transformer models available in the library. Discuss the capabilities and use cases of some of the popular models such as GPT-3, BERT, or others.
Chatbot Prototype Implementation:

Select a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face Transformers that you would like to use for your chatbot. Choose a model that is suitable for conversational generation.
Implement a chatbot prototype using Python and the selected transformer model. You can use libraries like Transformers or Hugging Face's Transformers library.
Describe the architecture of your chatbot, including how it interacts with the pre-trained transformer model. Explain the process of input, processing, and output for user interactions.
Provide example chatbot conversations to showcase the chatbot's functionality. Include a variety of user inputs and responses to demonstrate the chatbot's versatility.
Documentation:

Document the code and steps you took to create the chatbot prototype.
Explain how the pre-trained transformer model is fine-tuned or utilized for the chatbot's conversational responses.
Include code snippets and examples of chatbot interactions.
Analysis:

Reflect on the capabilities and limitations of the chatbot prototype. Discuss the potential applications of such chatbots in real-world scenarios.
Share any challenges you encountered during implementation and how you addressed them.
Consider the ethical implications of chatbot development, particularly when using powerful language models.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your assignment as a well-organized document or Jupyter Notebook.
Ensure that your explanations are clear and include code snippets.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Research and understanding of the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Successful implementation of a chatbot prototype using a pre-trained transformer model.
Clarity in documenting the code and explaining the chatbot's architecture.
Insightful analysis of the chatbot's capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations.
