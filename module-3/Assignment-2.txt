NLTK Basics

Objective: Gain hands-on experience with the NLTK library for natural language processing.

In this assignment, you will dive into the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library to perform fundamental NLP tasks. You will install the NLTK library in your development environment, explore its functionalities, and apply various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging on a sample text dataset.

Instructions:

Install NLTK:

Install the NLTK library in your development environment. You can use pip or any other preferred package manager.
Sample Text Dataset:

Select or create a sample text dataset for NLP experimentation. This dataset can include sentences or paragraphs of text.
NLTK Tasks:

Use the NLTK library to perform the following NLP tasks on your sample text dataset:
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
Stemming: Apply stemming to reduce words to their root or base form.
Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS): Label each word in the text with its corresponding part of speech (e.g., noun, verb).
Documentation:

Document the code and steps you took to perform each NLTK task.
Explain the purpose and significance of each task. Why are tokenization, stemming, and POS tagging important in NLP?
Provide examples of input text and the resulting output after each NLP task.
Results and Analysis:

Reflect on the outcomes of each NLTK task. Discuss how these tasks can be useful in chatbot development or other NLP applications.
Share any challenges or interesting insights you encountered during the experimentation.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your assignment as a well-organized document or Jupyter Notebook.
Ensure that your explanations are clear and include code snippets.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful installation of the NLTK library.
Correct implementation of tokenization, stemming, and POS tagging.
Clarity in documenting the code and explaining the purpose of each task.
Insightful analysis of the relevance of these NLP tasks in chatbot development.
