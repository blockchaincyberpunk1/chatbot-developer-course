spaCy for NLP

Objective: Learn about the spaCy library and its capabilities.

In this assignment, you will explore the spaCy library, a popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) library known for its speed and efficiency. You will install spaCy, download the necessary language model(s), and perform various NLP tasks such as entity recognition, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition (NER) on a text dataset.

Instructions:

Install and Setup spaCy:

Install the spaCy library in your development environment using pip.
Download the appropriate language model(s) for your desired language(s) using spaCy. You can choose models for languages like English, Spanish, or others.
Sample Text Dataset:

Select or create a sample text dataset for NLP experimentation. This dataset should contain text that you can use for entity recognition, dependency parsing, and NER tasks.
spaCy NLP Tasks:

Use spaCy to perform the following NLP tasks on your sample text dataset:
Entity Recognition: Identify and extract entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) from the text.
Dependency Parsing: Analyze the grammatical structure of sentences and identify relationships between words.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Detect and classify named entities such as persons, organizations, and dates.
Documentation:

Document the code and steps you took to perform each spaCy-based NLP task.
Explain the purpose and significance of each task. Why are entity recognition, dependency parsing, and NER important in NLP?
Provide code snippets and examples of input text along with the resulting output for each task.
Results and Analysis:

Reflect on the outcomes of each spaCy-based NLP task. Discuss how these tasks can be useful in chatbot development or other NLP applications.
Share any challenges or interesting insights you encountered during the experimentation.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your assignment as a well-organized document or Jupyter Notebook.
Ensure that your explanations are clear and include code snippets.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful installation of spaCy and language model(s).
Correct implementation of entity recognition, dependency parsing, and NER using spaCy.
Clarity in documenting the code and explaining the purpose of each spaCy-based NLP task.
Insightful analysis of the relevance of these NLP tasks in chatbot development.
