Chatbot Prototype with Python

Objective: Apply your programming knowledge to create a basic chatbot prototype.

In this assignment, you will put your programming skills to work by developing a simple chatbot prototype using the Python programming language. The chatbot should be capable of responding to user input with predefined responses, allowing for basic user interactions and conversation flow.

Instructions:

Chatbot Prototype Development:

Using Python, create a simple chatbot prototype.
Design the chatbot to have predefined responses for a set of user inputs. The responses can be related to a specific topic or purpose.
Implement a conversation flow that allows the chatbot to engage in a basic back-and-forth interaction with the user.
Ensure that your chatbot provides responses that are relevant to the user's input.
User Interaction Examples:

Include a set of example user interactions to showcase how the chatbot responds to different inputs.
Test your chatbot with various inputs to demonstrate its capabilities.
Documentation:

Document your chatbot development process, including the structure of your code, the purpose or theme of your chatbot, and any libraries or modules used.
Explain the logic behind how your chatbot processes user input and generates responses.
Reflection:

Reflect on the experience of creating the chatbot prototype. Discuss any challenges faced and lessons learned during the development process.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your assignment in a well-organized Python script or Jupyter Notebook file.
Ensure that your code is clear and well-documented.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct functionality of the chatbot prototype.
Clarity and organization of the code.
Explanation of the chatbot's logic and response generation.
Reflection on the development process.
