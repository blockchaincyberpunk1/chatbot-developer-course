Data Structures Exploration

Objective: Study data structures that are commonly used in programming.

In this assignment, you will explore fundamental data structures commonly used in programming and their relevance to chatbot development. You will research and provide an overview of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and dictionaries. Additionally, you will create code examples to showcase the implementation and usage of these data structures in the programming language you have chosen for chatbot development.

Instructions:

Data Structure Overview:

Research and provide an overview of fundamental data structures, including but not limited to:
Arrays
Linked Lists
Dictionaries (or Hash Tables)
Explain the purpose and common use cases of each data structure.
Code Examples:

For each of the identified data structures, write code examples in your selected programming language to demonstrate their implementation.
Include comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each code snippet.
Showcase operations like data insertion, retrieval, and deletion.
Application in Chatbot Development:

Discuss how each data structure is relevant to chatbot development. Provide specific examples of scenarios where chatbots may benefit from using these data structures.
Documentation:

Document your research findings, including the overview of data structures, and provide explanations for each code example you have written.
Presentation (Optional):

If presenting your assignment, consider creating a brief presentation to explain the concepts and demonstrate the code examples.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your assignment in a well-organized format, such as a document, presentation slides, or any other suitable format.
Ensure that your documentation is clear, well-structured, and includes comments to explain code snippets.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Thoroughness and clarity of the data structure overview.
Correct implementation of data structure code examples.
Adherence to programming language syntax and conventions.
Quality of documentation and presentation (if applicable).
