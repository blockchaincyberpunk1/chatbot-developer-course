Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for Rule-Based Chatbots

Objective: Enhance rule-based chatbots with NLU capabilities.

In this assignment, you will take your rule-based chatbot to the next level by integrating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities. NLU enables chatbots to understand user intents, extract entities, and provide more context-aware responses. You will select an NLU library or framework (e.g., spaCy, Rasa NLU) and integrate it into your existing rule-based chatbot. By the end of this assignment, you should be able to demonstrate how NLU enhances the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to user inputs effectively.

Instructions:

Part 1: Select an NLU Framework:

Research and select an NLU library or framework that is suitable for your chatbot project. Consider factors such as ease of integration, support for intent recognition, and entity extraction.
If you're unsure which framework to choose, consult with your instructor or peers for recommendations.
Part 2: Integrate NLU:

Integrate the selected NLU framework into your existing rule-based chatbot. Ensure that your chatbot can now recognize user intents and extract entities from text inputs.
Update your chatbot's conversational flow to incorporate NLU. This may involve modifying your if-else statements or switch-case logic to consider recognized intents and entities.
Part 3: Provide Examples:

Create examples of conversations between users and your chatbot to showcase how NLU enhances its capabilities.
Demonstrate how the chatbot recognizes user intents and extracts entities from user inputs.
Include scenarios where users provide variations of intents and entities to test the chatbot's NLU capabilities.
Part 4: Present Code Snippets:

Share code snippets that demonstrate the integration of NLU into your chatbot. Highlight the key components and functions related to NLU within your chatbot code.
Part 5: Reflection:

Reflect on the impact of NLU integration. Discuss how it has improved your chatbot's ability to understand user inputs and provide more context-aware responses.
Consider any challenges or limitations you encountered during the integration process.
Part 6: Submission:

Submit your enhanced rule-based chatbot, including the NLU integration, conversation examples, code snippets, and your reflection.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful integration of NLU into the chatbot.
Quality and relevance of conversation examples that demonstrate NLU capabilities.
Clarity and completeness of code snippets showcasing NLU integration.
Thoughtful reflection on the impact of NLU on chatbot performance.
