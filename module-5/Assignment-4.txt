Dialogflow Chatbot Development

Objective: Explore the development of chatbots using Google Dialogflow.

In this assignment, you will dive into the world of chatbot development using Google Dialogflow, a powerful tool for creating conversational interfaces. You will learn about Dialogflow's architecture, intents, entities, and fulfillment features. Your objective is to develop a chatbot prototype for a specific use case using Dialogflow and share the design, interactions, and any custom integrations or fulfillment functions you implement.

Instructions:

Part 1: Use Case Selection:

Choose a specific use case for your Dialogflow chatbot prototype. Examples include a travel booking chatbot, a weather information chatbot, or any other use case that interests you.
Part 2: Dialogflow Setup:

Set up a new Dialogflow project in your Google Cloud account (if you don't have one, sign up for Google Cloud and activate Dialogflow).
Familiarize yourself with Dialogflow's interface, including the console and the concepts of intents, entities, and fulfillment.
Part 3: Intent Design:

Create intents in Dialogflow to represent the various interactions your chatbot will support. Define training phrases, responses, and parameters as needed.
Implement follow-up intents to handle multi-turn conversations.
Part 4: Entity Recognition:

Define custom entities or use system entities to extract relevant information from user inputs.
Ensure that entities are correctly annotated in your intents to capture user-provided data.
Part 5: Fulfillment and Integration:

Implement fulfillment logic for your chatbot. You can use Dialogflow's built-in fulfillment editor or integrate with external services (e.g., webhooks).
Add custom fulfillment functions to process user requests and generate dynamic responses.
Part 6: Interaction Flow:

Design the conversation flow of your chatbot. Create a flowchart or diagram to illustrate how users will interact with the chatbot.
Include examples of user inputs and the corresponding chatbot responses.
Part 7: Testing and Debugging:

Test your chatbot within Dialogflow's console to ensure it understands user inputs and responds appropriately.
Debug any issues or errors that may arise during testing.
Part 8: Documentation:

Document the key components of your Dialogflow chatbot, including intents, entities, fulfillment logic, and interaction flow.
Explain any custom integrations or external services used for fulfillment.
Part 9: Submission:

Submit your Dialogflow chatbot prototype, including the design, interactions, and documentation.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful development of a chatbot prototype using Google Dialogflow.
Quality and relevance of the chatbot's intents, entities, and fulfillment logic.
Clarity and completeness of documentation, including explanations of key components and integrations.
Demonstration of effective testing and debugging practices.
